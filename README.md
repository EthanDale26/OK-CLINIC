## 💡 **About the Project**

**OK Clinic** is a **web-based Veterinary Clinic Management System** developed as part of our integration project for **ITCC 33 (Systems Integration), CSCC 21 (API Development), and ITCC 14 (Database Systems)**.
This platform is designed to **streamline veterinary operations** by providing an all-in-one solution for managing **appointments, patient (pet) medical records, billing, and staff scheduling**.

The system allows pet owners to easily **book appointments online**, while veterinarians and clinic staff can **manage patient information, medical records, and invoices** through a secure and efficient interface. The integration of **MongoDB** and **Firebase** ensures reliable data storage and real-time updates, such as doctor availability and appointment notifications.

Built with **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express.js/NestJS)** for the backend, OK Clinic demonstrates our team’s ability to implement **RESTful APIs**, handle **secure data transactions**, and deliver a **responsive, user-centered application**.
Through this project, we aim to enhance digital efficiency in veterinary care while showcasing our technical and collaborative expertise.
